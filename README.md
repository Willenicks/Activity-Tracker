#### Indroduction

Here in Colorado there are a million activities to do outdoors. My favorites are running, biking, and hiking all over the state, and that is just during the summer. Winter can be a great time to get outdoors as well, with snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, fat tire biking, and downhill skiing to name a few.

This Application would be able to log all of your activity regardless of type. Once a user has logged in and created their profile, they would be able to manually enter data about that day’s activity. This application would enable the user to record:


•	The type of activity, selected from a preselected list, or input a new type of activity 
•	The date and time of the activity 
•	The time it took to complete the activity
•	The distance covered
•	The weather data
•	The difficulty ( beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert only)
•	Elevation covered
•	The average and top speed during the activity
•	Average heart rate
•	Conditions 
•	Additional data and pictures to remember the activity

Additionally, users will be able to customize their profile with a profile image or emoji, all with an active email account, once verified. 

Once their account is created, users will see the main page which will look similar to a calendar. On each date a user can record several different activities to record their outings throughout the year. This calendar will also serve as a record where users can look at past activities and compare it against their times the next time that event is completed. This way, users can see their progress as times improve or distances increase and their stamina improves.


The output of this could give you a tally by week, month or year by given activity with a total of distance traveled or number of a selected activities performed within a given timeframe. 

All users’ profiles will be private unless they share a url associated with their account to other users of the application and this permission is verified through an email sent to the owner of the url. This way friends can share their activity and share information regarding trail conditions, parking at certain trailheads, availability of restrooms at other locations and if a certain place is handicap accessible or not. 

Additionally, I would want users to create groups, chaired by one administrator who can be responsible for adding and removing members from the group. This way running, biking and other clubs can record their activities or plan future activities for their members. That way they could post meet up times, directions, and a synopsis of the route prior to people showing up and after the fact it would be entered into their activity log. 

There are a couple of sites similar to this and they are listed below:
